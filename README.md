# Nature Tours Website

This is a demo website for a fictional company that offers tours in nature. It showcases my frontend development skills and incorporates modern web development techniques. The website is built using HTML5, CSS3, and Sass, following the 7-1 pattern. It also includes responsive images with resolution and density switching, art direction, and thorough testing for browser support. Additionally, the website features various attractive animations to enhance the user experience. To streamline the development process, I have set up a simple build process using npm.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Esmat/natours-demo-website.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd natours-demo-website`
3. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the website to get an understanding of the company and its offerings. Navigate through the different pages, view the tour details, and use the contact form to get in touch.

You can modify the website to suit your needs or use it as a starting point for your own projects. Feel free to customize the design, add more features, or integrate it with a backend.

## Layout
The website layout is built using the float property in CSS, instead of modern techniques like display flex or grid. This was a deliberate choice to demonstrate proficiency in traditional layout methods. Although float has some limitations compared to flex and grid, it can still be used effectively in certain scenarios.

## Animations
The Nature Tours website incorporates various animations to create an engaging user experience. These animations are implemented using CSS3 properties such as `transition`, `transform`, and `keyframes`. They are applied to elements like buttons, navigation menus, and images to provide smooth transitions, hover effects, and other visually appealing interactions.

The animations aim to enhance the overall aesthetics and usability of the website, making it more interactive and captivating for users.

## Build Process
To streamline the development process, I have set up a simple build process using npm. Follow the steps below to build the project:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Open the project directory in a terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm run build` to trigger the build process.
5. The build artifacts will be generated in a `dist` or `build` directory.

The build process may include tasks like transpiling Sass to CSS, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, optimizing images, and creating a production-ready version of the website.
